Download the latest stable version (e.g., Redis-x64-x.x.x.zip).
Extract the ZIP file:

Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and select "Extract All" or use a tool like 7-Zip to extract it.
Run Redis server:

Open a Command Prompt as Administrator.
Navigate to the extracted folder using the cd command. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd C:\path\to\redis
Run the Redis server:
bash
Copy code
redis-server.exe
Run Redis CLI (optional):

In another Command Prompt window, navigate to the same folder and run:
bash
Copy code
redis-cli.exe
Starting the Redis Server
On Linux
To start the Redis server manually, you can run:
bash
Copy code
sudo service redis-server start
On Windows
If you are running it as a service, it should start automatically. Otherwise, run the command mentioned earlier:
bash
Copy code
redis-server.exe
Connecting to Redis
Use the Redis CLI to connect to your Redis server:

bash
Copy code
redis-cli
You can run commands like:

bash
Copy code
SET key "value"
GET key
Troubleshooting
Redis not starting on Linux: Check the status using:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status redis
Look for any error messages in the output.

Firewall issues on Windows: Ensure that the Redis port (default is 6379) is allowed through the Windows Firewall.

Conclusion
You have successfully installed and started the Redis server on your system. For further information on using Redis, check the official Redis documentation.
